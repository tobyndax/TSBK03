\section{Background information}
This project aims to implement Voronoi shattering. Shattering an object is one
part of the project while the other part is collision detection and response.
The collision part is used to make the fragments of the shattered object react
properly with eachother.

\subsection{Voronoi shattering}
This is a non physical way of shattering objects. The idéa is to create a
seed pattern inside the object you want to shatter. This pattern is then used
to create fragments from the original object. The original object is split using
a form of nearest neighbor. Lines are drawn at the maximum distance from each
point giving rise to a pattern as in figure \ref{fig:normPattern}. The object
is then split along these lines giving rise to one fragment for each seed.
The pattern can have different appearance depending on how you want your
fragments to look. A uniform seed pattern will give uniform fragments but if
you, for example, have a bullet hitting glass you want smaller fragments near
the impact point and larger fragments further away. This can be achieved by
choosing a non-uniform seed pattern with more and closer seeds near the impact
point and less sparser points further away.

    \label{fig:normPattern}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Seed pattern}
As mentioned above the seed pattern can be a powerful tool to make objects
shatter the way you want. Voronoi shattering is not based on physics which is
why it's important to know how to make the fragments look the way you want.
A wooden object, for example, doesn't shatter the same way as a ceramic object
would. The basic implementation of Voronoi shattering is specially useful for
materials as ceramic and glass since it looks very realistic.

Let's shatter a 2D square. A uniform pattern would result in uniform fragments
as in figure \ref{fig:uniPattern}. This is probably not a pattern you would
want to use when shattering object. Let's say that the square is made out of
glass. Using a pattern with random normal distributed points as in figure
\ref{fig:normPattern} we get fragment suitable for shattering glass. To
illustrate the power of seed pattern further let's shatter a square made out
of wood. Wood shatters in splinters along the fiber direction. The seed pattern
can be used to give a square the illusion of having a vertical fiber direction.
Using a random pattern that is more sparse in the vertical direction and more
compact in the horizontal direction we get the pattern in figure \ref{fig:woodPattern}.
This pattern can be further manipulated to get longer more slim splinters.

Usually we also have a impact point. Fragment near the impact point are usually
smaller than fragments further away. As mentioned above this can be achieved
by choosing a non-uniform seed pattern with more and closer seeds near the impact
point and less sparser points further away.

\subsection{Distance mapping}
One way to achieve wood like shattering is to manipulate the seed pattern as
mentioned above. Another way to do this is to scale the distance measurement
in the direction of the fibers when creating the Voronoi pattern.
Figure~\ref{fig:scaleDist} uses the same normal distributed pattern as
figure~\ref{fig:normPattern} but it uses a scaled distance in the y-direction.
It's scaled with a factor of SOME FACTOR.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Voronoi implementation}
The implementations is limited to shattering a cube with dynamic depth making
it possible to shatter both a cube and plane. The implementations is also
limited to "2.5D". With "2.5D" we mean that when shattering a cube we create a
Voronoi pattern and use it to shatter the front as well as the back. The front
and back are then connected with planes as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:shatterConnect}
The Voronoi implementations starts by generating a number of seed points with
random normal distributed positions. The number of seed points is taken as an
input argument to the function making it highly dynamic. A binary mask is created
for each seed point showing what points in the square that belong to what fragment.

The next step is finding the convex hull of each fragment or more precisely
the points on each fragment hull which are used to build the fragment. This is
done with the gift wrapping algorithm ref to this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm.
This algorithm is based on a starting point on the hull, we use the point
that we encounter first when scanning row by row in the fragments binary mask.
This is the top most left point. The algorithm then procedes to create a line
to a random point int the fragment. It then checks if any other point lies on
the left side of the line. If this is the case then the point on the left side
is used to create a new line with the starting point. The next point is the one
where no points are on the left side of the line between the current point and
the starting point. The next point is then used as starting point and the
algorithm starts over. This continues until the algorithm reaches the point
it started with.

Lets call the starting point A, the current point that forms the line with
the starting point is called B and the point for investigation is called C.
Equation \ref{eq:leftOf} to find out if C lies on the lies on the left side
of the line between B and A. Ax is the x position of point A, Ay is the
y position of A and so on. If the equation returns a value less than 0 then
C is to the left of the line, if it returns a value higher than 0 then C is on
the right side and if it returns 0 then C is on the line. In the case of
the equation returning 0 we want to use the point that is furthest away from A.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:leftOf}
  (Bx-Ax)*(Cy-Ay)-(By-Ay)*(Cx-Ax)
\end{equation}

\section{About our implementation}
\subsection{Voronoi shattering}
Naive and slow implementation but it works.

\subsection{Collision detection}
Worked ok?

\subsection{Collision response}
Didn't work, why not?

\section{Interesting problems}
Collision response proved to be a difficult problem. The detection part was somewhat
simple. We managed to detect collision with the ground as well as collision with
other objects.

\section{Limitations}
Can't shatter object, only a square. Can't do 3D, we have 2,5D.

\section{Conclusion}
